The Bus Reservation System is a Java-based console application designed to streamline the process of bus seat booking, cancellations and viewing seat availability.
It provides a user-friendly interface for passengers to reserve seats, input their details, make payments and manage their bookings efficiently. T
his system ensures transparency in ticketing and helps optimize seat utilization for bus operators.

How the System Works?
1. The system starts by allowing the admin to add seats (define total available seats).

2. A passenger can book a seat by providing personal details and selecting a route.

3. The system prompts for payment, and upon successful completion, the seat is reserved.

4. Users can view available seats, cancel a booking, or check passenger details.

5. The seats are displayed in an easy-to-read grid format, updating dynamically as changes occur.

6. The program runs in a continuous loop, allowing multiple operations until the user exits.
